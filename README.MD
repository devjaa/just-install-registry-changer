# Just-Install Registry Changer
## For the purpose of being able to easily modify the registry
Gets the [just-install registry](https://github.com/just-install/registry) from [rawgit](https://rawgit.com/just-install/registry/master/just-install.json) and adds a new entry. Currently only **very** simple options, but it works. Completely client side form + javascript. Also prettifies the outputted JSON with highlightjs. 

## Using the registry
### Methods:
1. Go [here](https://github.com/just-install/registry/edit/master/just-install.json) and replace the registry with your own, then commit and do pull request.
2. Clone [https://github.com/just-install/registry/](https://github.com/just-install/registry/), replace just-install.json with the outputted json, commit, push to your fork, and submit a pull request.
3. *To test your new registry*: follow the directions [here](https://github.com/just-install/registry#how-to-test-changes-locally)
